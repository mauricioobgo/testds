# testds
This dataset comprises several paper abstracts, one per file, that were furnished by the NSF
(National Science Foundation). A sample abstract is shown at the end.

Your task is developing an unsupervised model which classifies abstracts into a topic (discover
them!). Indeed, your goal is to group abstracts based on their semantic similarity.

You can get a sample of abstracts here. Be creative and state clearly your approach. Although
we donâ€™t expect accurate results but a good pipeline of your work.

It is affordable to create a notebook, like Jupyter (if you use python) or a Rmarkdown
report (in case you use R) and make it available for us, i.e. github.

Hint to success in your quest: Develop and stay clear of the data science process you'll
perform over the dataset and highlight important aspects you might consider affordable
to discuss over.
